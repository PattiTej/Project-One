## Introduction:

It was only more than a decade ago when the world was brought to its knees by what is called the Global Financial Crisis (“GFC”) brought about by the housing bubble in the United States coupled with the excessive risk-taking behaviour by the banking sector. Now, the world is facing another global recession brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. To say that the Covid-19 induced global recession could well be worse than the GFC may not be entirely false. The stock market crash in February of 2020 through end of March is seen as quick but the recession (and in some other countries, even a depression) was more lasting. There are predictions that some countries will only bounce back by year 2025. 

The measures taken by governments around the globe to have the pandemic under control included nationwide lockdowns and border closures which impacted trade and commerce both domestically and internationally. Tourism and hospitality are industries most negatively impacted resulting to significant rise in unemployment in these sectors. Consequently, unemployment caused food insecurity and rental and mortgage defaults. Governments around the globe had to step in to respond to the crisis by legislating stimulus packages which include monetary and/or fiscal stimulus to help businesses and individuals economically impacted by the pandemic. Stimulus packages calls for increased government spending and lowering of interest rates to fill in the output gaps in the economy. One effect of lowering interest rates is that the currency becomes less attractive to foreign investments thus weakening the exchange rate of the currency. This being said, how did the Covid-19 pandemic affect the US dollar as compared to gold and cryptocurrencies like the Bitcoin? Which of these currencies have responded negatively or positively to the pandemic and therefore which should one invest in considering that another black swan event like the Covid-19 pandemic may take place again?

## Purpose of the Project: 


    1.	Identify the best performing type of currency during a “normal period” and during the “pandemic period”.  Currencies under consideration are the USD, Gold, and the     Bitcoin. 
    
    2.	Provide simulated performances for each type of currency for both a “normal period” and a “pandemic period” to yield a forecast that will help illustrate which type of currency to invest in during “normal period” and a “pandemic period”.  
    
3.	Provide a visualisation of the findings based on the analysis conducted. 

## Hypothesis:

Factor: New Covid-19 outbreaks or mutation of Covid-19 against the vaccines

Independent Variable 1: If vaccine is effective and supply is efficient in 2021

      1. Economic recovery will put pressure on Bitcoin and Gold prices
      2. USD will be attractive again

Independent Variable 2: If there is a limited supply of vaccine or efficiency is lost due to virus mutation

      1. More or prolonged quarantine time or lockdowns which will result to additional stimulus package boosting safe haven assets
      2. Pressure on the value of the USD
